# r_data_analytics
This repository contains exercises and solutions to assignments from the classes of *Data Analytics: Methoden und Programmierung* at Berlin School of Economics and Law, held by Prof. Dr. Markus Loecher and Prof. Dr. Salmai Qari in 2021 summer semester.  

> While the solutions are mostly my work, the repository might contain instructions and group work yet (information about the respective author/s should be displayed in each file).
