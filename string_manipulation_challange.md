Write a function that reverses the order of the words of the input
sentence.

``` r
my.sentence
```

    ## [1] "here is long sentence, potentially generated by reading from some text-file"

``` r
my.wordSeqReverse(my.sentence)
```

    ##  [1] "text-file"   "some"        "from"        "reading"     "by"         
    ##  [6] "generated"   "potentially" "sentence,"   "long"        "is"         
    ## [11] "here"

Now we want a function that keeps the order of the sentence, but
reverses the words!

``` r
my.strReverse(my.sentence)
```

    ## [[1]]
    ##  [1] "e" "l" "i" "f" "-" "t" "x" "e" "t" "e" "m" "o" "s" "m" "o" "r" "f" "g" "n"
    ## [20] "i" "d" "a" "e" "r" "y" "b" "d" "e" "t" "a" "r" "e" "n" "e" "g" "y" "l" "l"
    ## [39] "a" "i" "t" "n" "e" "t" "o" "p" "," "e" "c" "n" "e" "t" "n" "e" "s" "g" "n"
    ## [58] "o" "l" "s" "i" "e" "r" "e" "h"
