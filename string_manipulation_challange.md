## Reverse Strings

Write a function that reverses the order of the words of the input sentence.



```r
my.sentence
```

```
## [1] "here is long sentence, potentially generated by reading from some text-file"
```

```r
my.wordSeqReverse(my.sentence)
```

```
## [1] "text-file some from reading by generated potentially sentence, long is here"
```

Now we want a function that keeps the order of the sentence, but
reverses the words!



```r
my.sentence
```

```
## [1] "here is long sentence, potentially generated by reading from some text-file"
```

```r
my.strReverse(my.sentence)
```

```
## [1] "ereh si gnol ,ecnetnes yllaitnetop detareneg yb gnidaer morf emos elif-txet"
```

## 1 Remove Vowel

According to a linguistic theory, texts are still readable when the vowels are missing.

### 1.1 First Task:

Consider the following function `is.vowel(char)` which returns `TRUE` if the character is a vowel. Vowels are defined as `a`, `e`, `i`, `o` and `u`.


```r
is.vowel <- function(char) {
  if(char == "a" || char == "e" || char == "i" || char == "o" || char == "u")
    return(TRUE)
  return(FALSE)
}
```

Testing the function:

```r
is.vowel("e")
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```


```r
is.vowel("f")
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

Tasks:

• Explain how the function works

> The Function checks if the given `char` is either one of the vowels defined and returns `TURE` or `FALSE` respectively. (It compares the value of `char` with each value for the vowels)

• What happens if we enter the following (and why):


```r
is.vowel(c("e","g"))
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

> `is.fowel()` checks if the first argument has a value associated with one of the vowels defined. `"e"` meets the criterium of `char == "e"`, so `TRUE` is returned. Either way, the first comparison leads to an execution of `return()` and therefore exits the function. All other values after the first one are ignored.


### 1.2 Extension

Now write a function `remove.vowels(string)` that removes all vowels in the sentence. Are the linguists right?



Testing the function (using strwrap is not necessary, but it improves ease of reading for pdf-files): We first enter a string:


```r
text.1 <- "Tours of the campus were very popular. Student guides showed more than 100 curious guests around the campus, answering a range of questions on the way."
strwrap(text.1)
```

```
## [1] "Tours of the campus were very popular. Student guides showed more than" 
## [2] "100 curious guests around the campus, answering a range of questions on"
## [3] "the way."
```

Now we apply the function to the string:


```r
strwrap(remove.vowels(text.1) )
```

```
## [1] "Trs f th cmps wr vry pplr. Stdnt gds shwd mr thn 100 crs gsts rnd th"
## [2] "cmps, nswrng rng f qstns n th wy."
```

### 1.3 Sets

The function `is.element(el, set)` works on vectors and returns `TRUE` for each `el` in `set`. Example:




```r
is.element(el=c("a","b","c"),set=c("i","a"))
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

Write down (on paper) a function `is.vowel.vect` that accepts a vector of characters as an input.



Testing


```r
is.vowel.vect(c("a","b","c","i"))
```

```
##     a     b     c     i 
##  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
```

## 2 Interchange Letters

According to a second theory, it is still possible to read a text, if only the first and the last letter are on the right position and the rest is randomly interchanged.

### 2.1 Step 1

Write a function that randomly interchanges all the letters of a word.



Testing the function:


```r
interchange.word("of")
```

```
## [1] "fo"
```


```r
interchange.word("Testfunction")
```

```
## [1] "cnesitunoTtf"
```


```r
interchange.word("Testfunction")
```

```
## [1] "noecstitTfnu"
```

### 2.2 Step 2

Now write a function that exchanges only the characters of the middle of the word (between first and last character) Use your function from step 1. The function should not change anything, if the word is composed of less than 4 characters.

The function has an argument called exclude which is vector of potential punctuation marks at the end of a word. You can assume that there is only one possible punctuation mark. If there is such a mark, it should not be changed and not counted towards the number of characters the actual word is composed of.
Hence, Tes. is a three-character word and therefore nothing will be changed. Use the following vector of punctuation marks: exclude=c(",",".","!","?").

In summary, the function header should look like this:



Testing the function:


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("Tes")
```

```
## [1] "Tes"
```


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("Tes")
```

```
## [1] "Tes"
```


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("Hm?")
```

```
## [1] "Hm?"
```


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("Hm!")
```

```
## [1] "Hm!"
```


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("well!")
```

```
## [1] "well!"
```


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("well!")
```

```
## [1] "well!"
```


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("well!")
```

```
## [1] "well!"
```


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("hello?")
```

```
## [1] "hlelo?"
```


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("Testfunction!")
```

```
## [1] "Tufscotneitn!"
```


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("Testfunction?")
```

```
## [1] "Tsicutoeftnn?"
```


```r
interchange.middle.of.word("Testfunction,")
```

```
## [1] "Tefuitntscon,"
```
